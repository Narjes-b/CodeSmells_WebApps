# CodeSmells_WebApps

This is a replication package of the paper titled "A Longitudinal Exploratory Study on the Prevalence,Co-occurence, and Impact of Code Smells in WebApplications"

In this package you will find:

1- For every studied project, we provide the associated datasets including the LOC and code churn values for all smelly and non smelly files.
2- We provide in the folder "Script", the script we used to (1) extract all files LOC, code churn, changes types, and commits, (2) identify all bug-inducing commits related to every file.
3- The OccAllApp.csv contain all types of code smells found in each smelly file of the 400+ studied releases.
